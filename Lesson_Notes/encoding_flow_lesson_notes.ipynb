    "### Understanding Thrift in Plain Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Thrift is a tool that helps different programs talk to each other, even if they are written in different programming languages. It does this by defining a common language, called a schema, that both programs can understand. This schema is written in a `.thrift` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schema Definition**: You describe the structure of your data in a `.thrift` file. For example, you can define a `Person` with fields like `name`, `age`, and `hobbies`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Generation**: Thrift takes the `.thrift` file and generates code in your preferred programming language. This code helps you easily work with the data structure you defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Encoding**: When you want to send data, Thrift converts it into a compact binary format. This format is small and efficient, making it faster to send over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**: Thrift also allows you to define services in the `.thrift` file. A service is like a list of actions that one program can ask another program to perform. For example, a `School` service might have an action like `teachCourse` to add a course to a person’s list of hobbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cross-Language Communication**: Since Thrift generates code for many programming languages, you can have a Python program talk to a Java program, or any other combination, as long as they both use the same `.thrift` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Thrift is a powerful tool for making programs work together by providing a common way to define data and actions, and by efficiently encoding data for communication."

    "- The class name `School` matches the service name in our `.thrift` file\n",
    "- This class will contain the actual implementation of our service methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 7:** `def teachCourse(self, person, course):`\n",

    "### What are struct, service, and method? — linked to the notebook example\n",
    "\n",
    "This short reference ties the abstract terms used in Thrift to the concrete example in the notebook (`schema/person.thrift` and the generated Python code).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Struct (example: `Person`)\n",
    "  - Plain meaning: a struct is a schema for a data record — a named collection of fields (like a small form or a typed dictionary).\n",
    "  - In the notebook: `struct Person { 1: required string userName, 2: optional i64 favoriteNumber, 3: optional list<string> interests }` defines what data a Person contains.\n",
    "  - At runtime: after loading the schema with Thrift (`thriftpy2.load(...)`) you get a Python class `person_thrift.Person` you can instantiate and send over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Service (example: `School`)\n",
    "  - Plain meaning: a service is a named collection (an interface) of remote operations — think of it as the API surface that other programs can call.\n",
    "  - In the notebook: `service School { Person teachCourse(1: required Person person, 2: required string course) }` declares the API the server will expose.\n",
    "  - At runtime: Thrift exposes `person_thrift.School` as the service interface. You implement those methods in a Python class (commonly named `School`) and bind it to a server with `make_server(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Method (example: `teachCourse`)\n",
    "  - Plain meaning: a method is a single operation/remote procedure inside a service — a callable action that accepts arguments and returns a value.\n",
    "  - In the notebook: `teachCourse` takes a `Person` and a `course` string and returns a `Person`.\n",
    "  - At runtime: the client calls `client.teachCourse(person, \"coding\")`; the client stub serializes the arguments, sends them to the server, and the server implementation (the `teachCourse` method on your `School` class) runs and returns a `Person` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "How they map together (quick flow):\n",
    "1. Write `struct` + `service` in `schema/person.thrift`.\n",
    "2. Load schema in Python: `person_thrift = thriftpy2.load(\"./schema/person.thrift\", ...)` → gives `person_thrift.Person` and `person_thrift.School`.\n",
    "3. Server: implement a Python class with methods matching the service (e.g., `def teachCourse(self, person, course): ...`) and run `make_server(person_thrift.School, School(), ...)`.\n",
    "4. Client: create a client stub with `make_client(person_thrift.School, ...)`, build a `person_thrift.Person(...)`, and call `client.teachCourse(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical tips / gotchas\n",
    "- Optional fields may be None — server code should guard before using lists (check `if person.interests is None:` before appending). \n",
    "- Methods can mutate objects in place and return them; clients expect the returned object to reflect changes.\n",
    "- The service name and the Python implementation class may share the same name (e.g., `School`) — that's normal but don't confuse the *service interface* (schema) with the *class that implements it* (runtime object)."

    "### What are `person.thrift` and `person_thrift_server.py` (purpose & how they work together)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `person.thrift` (schema / contract)\n",
    "  - Purpose: defines the data structures and RPC API contract. It contains the `struct` definitions (e.g., `Person`) and `service` definitions (e.g., `School` with methods like `teachCourse`).\n",
    "  - Role: a language-agnostic specification that both client and server rely on. Field tags, types, and required/optional flags live here.\n",
    "  - When used: tools or libraries (here `thriftpy2`) read this file and produce language-specific classes/interfaces you use at runtime.\n",
    "  - Practical notes: maintain stable field tag numbers; make new fields optional for compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `person_thrift_server.py` (server implementation)\n",
    "  - Purpose: provides the runtime implementation of the service declared in the schema. It loads the schema, implements the service methods in a Python class (e.g., `class School`), and starts an RPC server.\n",
    "  - Role: receives encoded requests from clients, decodes them into `Person` objects, executes the method logic (e.g., add a course, assign a grade), and returns encoded responses.\n",
    "  - Key lines to look for in the file:\n",
    "    - schema load: `thriftpy2.load(\"./schema/person.thrift\", ...)` — imports the generated types and service interface\n",
    "    - implementation: `class School(...): def teachCourse(self, person, course): ...` — the server-side logic\n",
    "    - server start: `make_server(person_thrift.School, School(), ...)` and `server.serve()` — binds implementation to RPC and listens for clients\n",
    "  - Practical notes: guard against missing optional fields (e.g., ensure `person.interests` exists before appending); ensure server and clients use the same schema file/version.\n",
    "\n",
    "How they fit together (quick flow):\n",
    "1. Author `person.thrift` (the contract).\n",
    "2. Server loads the contract, implements methods, and starts serving (`person_thrift_server.py`).\n",
    "3. Clients load the same contract, create `Person` instances, and call remote methods — data flows encoded across the network and is decoded by the other side.\n",

    "If you want, I can also add a small annotated snippet in the notes showing the exact lines from both files and a one-line explanation beside each — shall I add that?"

    "- `service` (the API surface)\n",
    "  - Purpose: groups related remote procedures into a named API, e.g., `service School { ... }`.\n",
    "  - Runtime role: code generation creates server interfaces and client *stubs* (or, with gRPC, strongly-typed stubs) so servers implement the interface and clients call methods remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rpc` (method)\n",
    "  - Purpose: declares a single remote procedure (method) in the service with a specific request and response message type, e.g., `rpc teachCourse(CourseRequest) returns (Person)`.\n",
    "  - Runtime role: the client calls the generated stub method; the runtime serializes the request message, sends it to the server, the server runs the implemented method and returns a serialized response.\n",

    "Quick analogies & tips\n",
    "- Think \"message = typed record / struct\", \"service = interface / API\", and \"rpc = a function signature on that API\". \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 1:** `def teach_course(stub, person, course):`\n",
    "- Defines a helper function that wraps the gRPC call\n",
    "- Takes three parameters:\n",
    "  - `stub`: the gRPC client stub (connection to the server)\n",
    "  - `person`: a `Person` message object\n",
    "  - `course`: a string representing the course name\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 2:** `person = stub.teachCourse(person_pb2.CourseRequest(person=person, course=course))`\n",
    "- **`person_pb2.CourseRequest(person=person, course=course)`**: Creates a new `CourseRequest` message\n",
    "  - This wraps our `person` and `course` parameters into the request format expected by the server\n",
    "  - The server method signature requires a single `CourseRequest` parameter, not separate arguments\n",
    "- **`stub.teachCourse(...)`**: Makes the actual remote procedure call\n",
    "  - `stub` is the client-side proxy that handles network communication\n",
    "  - Serializes the `CourseRequest`, sends it to the server, waits for response\n",
    "  - The server runs its `teachCourse` method and returns a `Person` message\n",
    "  - The stub deserializes the response back into a Python `Person` object\n",
    "- **`person = ...`**: Assigns the returned `Person` object to the `person` variable\n",
    "  - This overwrites the original person with the modified version from the server\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 3:** `return person`\n",
    "- Returns the modified `Person` object that came back from the server\n",
    "- This person now has the new course added to their interests list\n",

    "#### Main Client Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051') as channel:\n",
    "    martin = person_pb2.Person(user_name='Martin', favorite_number=1337, interests=[\"daydreaming\", \"hacking\"])\n",
    "    course = \"coding\"\n",
    "    stub = person_pb2_grpc.SchoolStub(channel)\n",
    "    martin = teach_course(stub, martin, course)\n",
    "    print(martin.interests)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 1:** `with grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051') as channel:`\n",
    "- **`grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051')`**: Creates a connection to the gRPC server\n",
    "  - `'localhost:50051'` specifies the server address and port (must match the server's port)\n",
    "  - `insecure_channel` means no encryption/TLS (fine for local development)\n",
    "  - For production, you'd use `secure_channel` with proper certificates\n",
    "- **`with ... as channel:`**: Uses a context manager to ensure the connection is properly closed\n",
    "  - The connection will be automatically closed when the block exits\n",
    "  - Even if an exception occurs, the connection cleanup is guaranteed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 2:** `martin = person_pb2.Person(user_name='Martin', favorite_number=1337, interests=[\"daydreaming\", \"hacking\"])`\n",
    "- Creates a new `Person` message object using the generated `person_pb2.Person` class\n",
    "- Sets the fields according to our schema:\n",
    "  - `user_name='Martin'` → sets field tag 1 (string)\n",
    "  - `favorite_number=1337` → sets field tag 2 (optional int64)\n",
    "  - `interests=[\"daydreaming\", \"hacking\"]` → sets field tag 3 (repeated string)\n",
    "- This creates a local Python object that matches our Protobuf schema\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 3:** `course = \"coding\"`\n",
    "- Simple string variable holding the course we want to add\n",
    "- This will be passed to the server as part of the `CourseRequest`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 4:** `stub = person_pb2_grpc.SchoolStub(channel)`\n",
    "- Creates a client stub for the `School` service\n",
    "- **`SchoolStub`**: Generated class that provides client-side methods for all service RPCs\n",
    "  - Has a `teachCourse` method that matches our service definition\n",
    "  - Handles serialization, network communication, and deserialization automatically\n",
    "- **`(channel)`**: Associates the stub with our gRPC connection\n",
    "  - All method calls on this stub will use this channel to reach the server\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 5:** `martin = teach_course(stub, martin, course)`\n",
    "- Calls our helper function to make the actual RPC call\n",
    "- Passes the stub (connection), martin (Person object), and course (string)\n",
    "- The function returns the modified martin with \"coding\" added to his interests\n",
    "- **Behind the scenes flow**:\n",
    "  1. Helper function creates `CourseRequest(person=martin, course=\"coding\")`\n",
    "  2. Stub serializes the request into binary format\n",
    "  3. gRPC sends the binary data over the network to localhost:50051\n",
    "  4. Server receives, deserializes, and processes the request\n",
    "  5. Server calls `teachCourse` method, adds course to interests\n",
    "  6. Server serializes and sends back the modified Person\n",
    "  7. Client stub deserializes the response into a Python Person object\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 6:** `print(martin.interests)`\n",
    "- Prints the updated interests list for martin\n",
    "- Should now include the original interests plus \"coding\"\n",
    "- Output would be something like: `['daydreaming', 'hacking', 'coding']`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Message Objects**: `person_pb2.Person` and `person_pb2.CourseRequest` are Python classes representing our Protobuf messages\n",
    "2. **Service Stub**: `person_pb2_grpc.SchoolStub` is a client proxy that makes remote calls look like local method calls\n",
    "3. **Channel**: `grpc.insecure_channel` manages the network connection to the server\n",
    "4. **Request/Response Flow**: Client creates request → serializes → network → server processes → serializes response → network → client deserializes\n",
    "5. **Type Safety**: The generated classes ensure we use the correct field names and types as defined in our schema"

    "### Apache Avro File Reading Code - Line by Line Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the Avro file reading code to understand what each line does, both technically and in plain language:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('../data/1k.variants.avro', 'rb') as f:\n",
    "    reader = fastavro.reader(f)\n",
    "    genomic_var_1k = [sample for sample in reader]\n",
    "    metadata = copy.deepcopy(reader.metadata)\n",
    "    writer_schema = copy.deepcopy(reader.writer_schema)\n",
    "    schema_from_file = json.loads(metadata['avro.schema'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 1:** `with open('../data/1k.variants.avro', 'rb') as f:`\n",
    "- **Technical Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Opens the Avro file in **binary read mode** (`'rb'`).\n",
    "  - `'../data/1k.variants.avro'` is the path to a genomic variation dataset with 1000 samples.\n",
    "  - Uses a context manager (`with`) to automatically close the file when done.\n",
    "  - Avro files are binary format, so we must open in binary mode (not text mode).\n",
    "- **Plain Language Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Think of it like: \"Open this data file like opening a book, but tell the computer it's written in a special binary language, not regular text.\"\n",
    "  - Why 'rb'? Like how you need different glasses to read different languages, computers need to know if a file contains text or binary data.\n",
    "  - The 'with' part: It's like saying \"when I'm done reading this book, automatically put it back on the shelf for me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 2:** `reader = fastavro.reader(f)`\n",
    "- **Technical Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Creates an Avro reader object using the `fastavro` library.\n",
    "  - The reader can parse the binary Avro format and extract both data and metadata.\n",
    "  - `f` is the file handle from line 1.\n",
    "  - This reader will allow us to iterate through all records in the file.\n",
    "- **Plain Language Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Think of it like: \"Get me a translator who understands this special Avro language and can convert it to something I can understand.\"\n",
    "  - Real-world analogy: Like hiring an interpreter when you visit a foreign country—they help you understand what's being said.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 3:** `genomic_var_1k = [sample for sample in reader]`\n",
    "- **Technical Explanation:**\n",
    "  - **List comprehension** that reads all records from the Avro file into memory.\n",
    "  - `reader` is iterable—each iteration gives you one record (sample).\n",
    "  - `sample` represents one genomic variant record from the dataset.\n",
    "  - `genomic_var_1k` becomes a Python list containing all 1000 genomic variant records.\n",
    "  - Each sample is converted from Avro binary format into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "- **Plain Language Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Think of it like: \"Go through every page in this book and copy all the information into my notebook.\"\n",
    "  - Real-world analogy: Like making photocopies of every recipe in a cookbook so you can use them later.\n",
    "  - What happens: The computer reads all 1000 genetic samples and puts them in a list you can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 4:** `metadata = copy.deepcopy(reader.metadata)`\n",
    "- **Technical Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Extracts metadata from the Avro file header.\n",
    "  - `reader.metadata`: Contains file-level information like schema, creation time, etc.\n",
    "  - `copy.deepcopy()`: Makes a complete independent copy of the metadata.\n",
    "  - Without deep copy, changes to metadata could affect the original reader object.\n",
    "  - Metadata includes information about how the file was created and encoded.\n",
    "- **Plain Language Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Think of it like: \"Make me a complete copy of the book's table of contents and publication information.\"\n",
    "  - Real-world analogy: Like photocopying the copyright page and index of a book for your records.\n",
    "  - Why copy? So you have your own version that won't change if something happens to the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 5:** `writer_schema = copy.deepcopy(reader.writer_schema)`\n",
    "- **Technical Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Extracts the **writer's schema**—the schema used when the file was written.\n",
    "  - This is the original schema definition that was used to encode the data.\n",
    "  - `copy.deepcopy()` again creates an independent copy.\n",
    "  - The writer's schema tells us the structure and types of fields in each record.\n",
    "  - Important for Avro because you need the exact schema to properly decode binary data.\n",
    "- **Plain Language Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Think of it like: \"Give me a copy of the instruction manual that was used to organize this data.\"\n",
    "  - Real-world analogy: Like getting a copy of the recipe format that was used to write down all the recipes in a cookbook.\n",
    "  - Why important? You need to know how the data was organized to understand what each piece means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 6:** `schema_from_file = json.loads(metadata['avro.schema'])`\n",
    "- **Technical Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Extracts the schema from metadata and parses it as JSON.\n",
    "  - `metadata['avro.schema']`: The schema is stored as a JSON string in the metadata.\n",
    "  - `json.loads()`: Converts the JSON string into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "  - This gives us a more accessible format to examine the schema structure.\n",
    "  - The schema describes field names, types, and structure of each genomic variant record.\n",
    "- **Plain Language Explanation:**\n",
    "  - Think of it like: \"Take this instruction manual and convert it from a compressed format into something easy to read and navigate.\"\n",
    "  - Real-world analogy: Like unfolding a complex origami instruction sheet into a simple step-by-step guide.\n",
    "  - Result: You get an easy-to-use dictionary that tells you what fields exist in your data and what types they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Format**: Avro files are binary, requiring `'rb'` mode and special parsing libraries\n",
    "2. **Schema Dependency**: Unlike JSON, Avro data can't be read without knowing the schema\n",
    "3. **Metadata Storage**: Avro embeds the schema and other metadata directly in the file header\n",
    "4. **Memory Loading**: The list comprehension loads all records into RAM (fine for 1000 records, consider streaming for larger files)\n",
    "5. **Deep Copying**: Ensures we have independent copies of metadata and schema for safe manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-world Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This genomic dataset contains information about genetic variations across 1000 samples, commonly used in bioinformatics research. The Avro format is ideal here because:\n",
    "- Compact binary encoding saves storage space\n",
    "- Schema evolution allows adding new fields as research progresses\n",
    "- Self-describing format includes metadata about the dataset"
